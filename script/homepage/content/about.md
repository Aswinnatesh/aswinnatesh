Curious? Then read on... 
<br><br>
I'm a electronics enthusiast by passion. Graduated from Stony Brook University with strong focus in ASIC/FPGA Digital Design. I love developing products/prototypes that are of use to people and society, and thatâ€™s how most of my free time is spent.
<br><br>
My interest in electronics started when I was a kid. I'm a hobbyist photographer and designer. Check out few of my works <a href="https://aswinnatesh.com/travel/">here</a>.
<!-- <br><br>
I look forward improving my skills and learning new stuff. -->
