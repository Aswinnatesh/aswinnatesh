      <description>Curious? Then read on&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m a electronics enthusiast by passion. Graduated from Stony Brook University with strong focus in ASIC/FPGA Digital Design. I love developing products/prototypes that are of use to people and society, and thatâ€™s how most of my free time is spent. My interest in electronics started when I was a kid. I&amp;rsquo;m a hobbyist photographer and designer. Check out few of my works here. Reach me at: aswinnateshv {at} gmail {dot} com</description>
